# DeadByDaylightModInstaller
The application allows to install mods by modifying pak files which is against the EULA, so do at your own risk. The limitation is that you can only install a few mods for the same pak file without the anticheat prompting with an error.
For more details on limitations of modifying pak files join Mod By Daylight discord server https://discord.gg/aAB2fecQtm and see #textures-pakediting.

Json mod package file is the only file you need to install a mod, no need to include ubulk files.

# Installing/uninstalling mods
Before installing or uninstalling any mod you need to set path to the Paks folder.
When the path is set, click on the install/uninstall button and choose json mod package to install/uninstall.
